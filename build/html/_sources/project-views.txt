Board, Calendar and List Views
==============================

For each project, tasks can be visualized with several views: **Board,
Calendar, List and Gantt**. Each view shows the result of the filter box
at the top. The search engine uses the `advanced
syntax <search.markdown>`__.

When the task limit is reached for a column, the background becomes red.
