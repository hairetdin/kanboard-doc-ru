Subtasks
========

Subtasks are useful to split the work of a task.

Each subtask:

-  Can be assigned to a project member
-  Have 3 different statuses: **Todo**, **In progress**, **Done**
-  Have time tracking information: **time spent** and **time estimated**
-  Be ordered by position

**Done**.

Subtask timer
-------------

-  Each time a subtask is in progress, the timer is also started. The
   timer can be started and stopped at any time.
-  The timer records the time spent on the subtask automatically. You
   can also change manually the value of the time spent field when you
   edit a subtask.
-  The time calculated is rounded to the nearest quarter. This
   information is recorded in a separate table.
-  The task time spent and time estimated is updated automatically
   according to the sum of all subtasks.
