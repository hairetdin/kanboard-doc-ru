Groups Management
=================

In Kanboard, each user can be a member of one or many groups. A group is
like a team or an organization.

Only administrators can create new groups and assign users.

Groups can be managed from **User management > View All Groups**. From
there, you can create groups and assign users.

   Group Management
Each project manager can authorize the access to a set of groups from
the `project permissions page <project-permissions.markdown>`__.

The external id is mainly used for external group providers. Kanboard
provides a LDAP group provider to `sync automatically groups from LDAP
servers <ldap-group-sync.markdown>`__.
